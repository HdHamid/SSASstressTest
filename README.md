ðŸš€ SSAS Tabular Stress Test Tool â€“ Now on GitHub!

Iâ€™ve just published a simple yet powerful console-based tool to run stress tests on on-premises SSAS Tabular models.

âœ… Fully customizable:
â€“ Enter your own connection string
â€“ Input multiple DAX queries interactively
â€“ Set the number of parallel threads

ðŸ§ª Designed to simulate concurrent DAX executions and measure response times under load.

Ideal for performance testing, optimization validation, or load simulations.
